      <description>I recently had the honor of being featured on dbt Labs&amp;rsquo; community spotlight! You can read more about it here.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s been an absolute pleasure to be a part of this community for a few years now. I&amp;rsquo;ve said it before during my talks, but working in data, especially in our space pushing the boundaries and defining what best practices should be, is difficult work. It&amp;rsquo;s a common trope, but most of the world&amp;rsquo;s data goes unanalyzed, and that means there&amp;rsquo;s so much more we can learn about our world if we&amp;rsquo;re able to effectively process and analyze it.</description>

      <description>About five months ago, I started my first training block ever to run a long distance race.&#xA;I think it is a common experience for many who grow up playing team sports to view running as a punishment. Missed your free throws? Run lines. Got blown out on your home field? Next practice, we&amp;rsquo;re running. The crazy thing is, I even ran cross country for a time growing up, but even then, that was about running a race to beat people.</description>

      <description>I recently spoke at dbt labs&amp;rsquo; Coalesce Conference in San Diego! Alongside the Head of Engineering for the Roche Go-to-market Analytics Department, Yannick Misteli and I discuss multi-project deployments of dbt to scale your analytics workflow. This talk precedes features that were announced at this Coalesce Conference around dbt mesh, discussing how Roche managed model interaction between dbt projects before these features existed.&#xA;You can watch a recording of the talk below:</description>

      <title>My First dbt-core Contribution!</title>

      <description>I recently made my first dbt-core open-source contribution! This contribution adds unmodified and old state selection methods to the dbt CLI. The main motivation is to make it easy to exclude late-binding views from our dbt job&amp;rsquo;s DAG, reducing the runtime overhead. You can see some details that precipitated this contribution here.&#xA;You can watch a short demo on the contribution below:&#xA;To take it for a spin yourself, you might run a command that excludes the intersection of views and unchanged models from the DAG:</description>
