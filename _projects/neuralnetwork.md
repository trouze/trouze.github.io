### Overview

This project aims to implement and build a deeper level of understanding in Neural Networks and how they work to learn just like the human brain does. Much of what you will see in this project is based on the first two chapters of the text by Michael Nielsen titled [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/). In this book, Nielsen builds a neural network that is capable of classifying handwritten digits, written in Python (2.7). For this project, I chose to build it in R as a special sort of challenge and to build my own understanding of what is truly going on under the hood.

To follow along or see the data, you can download from [my repository](https://github.com/trouze/UMNStuffs/blob/master/HW4NN.zip) on Github, which also includes the R script to load the data and build the Neural Network. What will follow will be two-fold: a TL;DR version of what a Neural Network is and how it works, and then an implementation in R for those who may want to learn how to do it in this language. If you truly want to learn about neural nets, I suggest you read the aforementioned NNDL textbook.
