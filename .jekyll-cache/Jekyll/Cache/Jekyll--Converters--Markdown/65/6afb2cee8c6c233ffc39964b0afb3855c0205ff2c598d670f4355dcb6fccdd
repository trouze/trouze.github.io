<p>I consider myself a passionate, lifelong learner, and books are certainly a part of that identity. As part of this engagement, Iâ€™ll take notes while reading to heighten retention. Youâ€™ll notice that these notes arenâ€™t written in a very organized manner (a byproduct of writing in the margin of books). While I never planned to publicly post these, I realized that itâ€™s possible this will be of value to someone. Beats letting these notes collect dust!</p>

<p>As a repayment, if you have any book recommendations that have been particularly impactful to you, Iâ€™d love to hear about it. Either reach out on <a href="https://tylerrouze.com/socials">social media</a> or send me an email via <a href="mailto:tyler@tylerrouze.com">tyler @ this domain</a>.
