<p>Motorhead, flying, golfing, baseball, hiking, skiing, bread making, guitar, you name it. My passions carry me in many different and odd directions,

<h3 id="life">Life</h3>

<p>I currently live in Minneapolis, Minnesota.</p>

<h3 id="work">Work</h3>

<p>I currently work for <a href="https://www.ecolab.com/">Ecolab</a> as a data analyst. I work on our Analytics and Digital Solutions team within our Supply Chain and Procurement group. Ecolab is a chemical company that engages in water engineering, hygeine, and sanitization solutions.</p>

<p>Our team focuses on extending the digital capabilities of our Supply Chain &amp; Procurement functions, leveraging cloud technology, Power BI, and our own decision support systems to help Ecolab purchase and move materials throughout the globe.</p>

<p>My job is to support and carry out the groundwork of how we move data, derive insights from data, and visualize data (whether aggregated or the result of a DSS) to help our logistics and procurement teams make better decisions.</p>

<h3 id="education">Education</h3>

<p>I have quite a passion for lifelong learning. So while much of education is in the <em>past</em>, I am definitely continuing to learn new topics right <em>/now</em>. Itâ€™s this passion that motivated me to learn web development by making this <a href="https://tylerrouze.com/blog/thewhy">website</a>. More formally, I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a degree in <a href="https://cse.umn.edu/isye">Industrial and Systems Engineering</a> (yes thatâ€™s me on the front page!). If you donâ€™t know what the IE curriculum entails, it is the science of Decision making, usually based on data, done so via:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Statistics</li>
  <li>Optimization</li>
  <li>Simulation</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to my time in college, I have strong passions for data-driven solutions and using technology to eliminate repetitive tasks and free up time for more creative tasks.</p>

<h3 id="current-interests">Current Interests</h3>
