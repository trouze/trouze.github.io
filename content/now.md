This page lists the most up-to-date information regarding what I am doing right *now*.

### A little bit about me.
Motorhead, flying, golfing, baseball, hiking, skiing, bread making, running, you name it. My passions carry me in many different and odd directions, but I wouldn't have it any other way.

### Life

I currently live in Austin, TX.

### Work

I currently work for [dbt Labs](https://www.getdbt.com) as a Resident Architect. My role focuses on helping dbt Labs' biggest dbt Cloud customers get more out of the platform, and ultimately steward them towards a more highly-functioning data team and platform. I combine a mix of technical hands-on experience with more strategic and architectural frameworks to help data teams, taking specific interests in data modeling practices, platform engineering principles, and developer workflows impact on productivity. I am a certified professional in a number of technologies, including [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/), and [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/). I'm also a contributor to the [dbt-core](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core) project.

### Volunteerism

I currently volunteer at [Marbridge](https://www.marbridge.org/), a residential community for adults with a wide range of cognitive disabilities, putting on Bingo every Thursday night for residents. I'm currently kicking around coaching a Special Olympics team, time permitting!

### Current Interests

Some of my current interests are:

* Modern Data Stack (especially [dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/community/spotlight))
* [Marathoning](https://www.strava.com/athletes/116840931) (I'll be running Grandma's in Duluth, [fundraising](https://pages.lls.org/tnt/ctx/chicago24/tylerrouze#Tylers-Team-In-Training-Fundraiser) and running Chicago this fall)
* Formula 1
* Aviation
* Any book on our Human Nature (psychology/sociology), especially those with data-driven research findings.

### Education

I have quite a passion for lifelong learning. So while much of education is in the *past*, I am definitely continuing to learn new topics right */now*. It's this passion that motivated me to learn web development by making this website. More formally, I earned my Bachelors degree from the University of Minnesota in [Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://cse.umn.edu/isye) (yes that's me on the front page!). If you don't know what the IE curriculum entails, it is the science of Decision making, usually based on data, done so via:

* Statistics
* Optimization
* Simulation

Thanks to my time in college, I have strong passions for data-driven solutions and using technology to eliminate repetitive tasks and free up time for more creative tasks.
