This page lists the most up-to-date information regarding what I am doing *right now*.

### A little bit about me.
Motorhead, flying, golfing, baseball, hiking, skiing, bread making, guitar, you name it. My passions carry me in many different and odd directions, but I wouldn't have it any other way.

### Life

I currently live in Austin, TX.

### Work

I currently work for [Analytics8](https://www.analytics8.com) as a data management consultant. My role focuses on modernizing clients' data architectures, data modeling practices, and developer workflows. I am a certified professional in a number of technologies, including [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/), and [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/). I have even made open-source contributions to the [dbt-core](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core) project!

### Education

I have quite a passion for lifelong learning. So while much of education is in the *past*, I am definitely continuing to learn new topics right */now*. It's this passion that motivated me to learn web development by making this [website](https://tylerrouze.com/blog/thewhy). More formally, I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a degree in [Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://cse.umn.edu/isye) (yes that's me on the front page!). If you don't know what the IE curriculum entails, it is the science of Decision making, usually based on data, done so via:

* Statistics
* Optimization
* Simulation

Thanks to my time in college, I have strong passions for data-driven solutions and using technology to eliminate repetitive tasks and free up time for more creative tasks.

### Current Interests

Some of my current interests are:

* Aviation ([Microsoft Flight Simulator](https://www.flightsimulator.com/) anyone?)
* Formula 1
* Any book on our Human Nature (psychology/sociology), especially those with data driven research findings.
* Modern Data Stack
* Anything cutting edge involving [Python](https://www.python.org/), [R](https://www.r-project.org/), or [Julia](https://julialang.org/) languages
