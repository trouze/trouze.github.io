I recently had the honor of being featured on dbt Labs' community spotlight! You can read more about it [here](https://docs.getdbt.com/community/spotlight/tyler-rouze).

It's been an absolute pleasure to be a part of this community for a few years now. I've said it before during my talks, but working in data, especially in our space pushing the boundaries and defining what best practices should be, is difficult work. It's a common trope, but most of the world's data goes unanalyzed, and that means there's so much more we can learn about our world if we're able to effectively process and analyze it. Fundamentally, I believe that's what many of us are trying to do in the "Modern Data Stack" space. We've come a long way, but have a long ways to go in terms of settling on best in breed developer tools and workflows. It's only through collaboration and the willingness to be vulnerable and share what we're working on that we can continue to move this community forward, and I'm glad to be a part of it.

As always, if you want to talk data with me, use any one of the links on my [homepage](https://tylerrouze.com) to get in touch the way you prefer.
