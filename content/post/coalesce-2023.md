I recently spoke at dbt labs' Coalesce Conference in San Diego! Alongside the Head of Engineering for the Roche Go-to-market Analytics Department, [Yannick Misteli](https://ch.linkedin.com/in/yannick-misteli-b86129105) and I discuss multi-project deployments of dbt to scale your analytics workflow. This talk precedes features that were announced at this Coalesce Conference around [dbt mesh](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-1-intro), discussing how Roche managed model interaction between dbt projects before these features existed.

You can watch a recording of the talk below:

If you work for an analytics team thinking about adopting a multi-project architecture with dbt, I'm always happy to discuss your vision with you and offer insights having done this at scale. Comment below or reach out to me via tyler [at] tylerrouze.com!
