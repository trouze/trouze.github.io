### This page lists the most up-to-date information regarding what I am doing *right now*.

### A little bit about me.
Motorhead, flying, golfing, baseball, hiking, bread making, guitar, you name it. My passions carry me in many different and odd directions,
but I wouldn't have it any other way. Here's some photos as to what I've been up to of late.

### Life

I currently live in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

### Work

I currently work for [Kambr](https://www.kambr.com/) as an analyst for their Advisory Services Group. Kambr also has a software platform and media group, which are based in Amsterdam. Much of my work for Kambr involves formulating data driven solutions for airline clients across the globe, working through on-site Kambr consultants from my home base in Minneapolis to build solutions for the ever-changing airline industry.

### School

I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering. Most people don't know or have
a good idea of what ISyE is, so allow me to explain it quickly. There are many ways to put it, but one of the best ways I've come
up with that's resonated with the most people, is that it's the science of decision making. Of course, most majors teach you to make decisions,
but ISyE focuses on doing so via:

* Data
* Statistics
* Optimization
* Simulation
* Financial Modeling

### Current Interests

It's no secret that our interests change. Some of my current interests are listed below.

* Aviation
* The Principles of [The Go Giver](https://thegogiver.com)
* [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) and [Julia programming](https://julialang.org/) language
