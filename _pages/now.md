### This page lists the most up-to-date information regarding what I am doing *right now*.

### A little bit about me.
Motorhead, flying, golfing, baseball, hiking, skiing, bread making, guitar, you name it. My passions carry me in many different and odd directions,
but I wouldn't have it any other way.

### Life

I currently live in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

### Work

I currently work for [Analytics8](https://www.analytics8.com) as a data engineering consultant. This is a recently new role for me, so there'll be more to update here going forward. That said, my focuses are within the Modern Data Stack, mainly doing technology and cloud enablement using Google Cloud Platform as well as data warehousing tools like Snowflake and Databricks.

### Education

I have quite a passion for lifelong learning. So while much of education is in the *past*, I am definitely continuing to learn new topics right */now*. It's this passion that motivated me to learn web development by making this [website](https://tylerrouze.com/blog/thewhy). More formally, I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a degree in [Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://cse.umn.edu/isye) (yes that's me on the front page!). If you don't know what the IE curriculum entails, it is the science of Decision making, usually based on data, done so via:

* Statistics
* Optimization
* Simulation

Thanks to my time in college, I have strong passions for data-driven solutions and using technology to eliminate repetitive tasks and free up time for more creative tasks.

### Current Interests

Some of my current interests are:

* Aviation ([Microsoft Flight Simulator](https://www.flightsimulator.com/) anyone?)
* Formula 1
* Any book on our Human Nature (psychology/sociology), especially those with data driven research findings.
* Modern Data Stack
* Anything cutting edge involving [Python](https://www.python.org/), [R](https://www.r-project.org/), or [Julia](https://julialang.org/) languages
