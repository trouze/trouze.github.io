### This page lists the most up-to-date information regarding what I am doing *right now*.

### A little bit about me.
Motorhead, flying, golfing, baseball, hiking, skiing, bread making, guitar, you name it. My passions carry me in many different and odd directions,
but I wouldn't have it any other way.

### Life

I currently live in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

### Work

I currently work for [Ecolab](https://www.ecolab.com/) as a data analyst. I work on our Analytics and Digital Solutions team within our Supply Chain and Procurement group. Ecolab is a chemical company that engages in water engineering, hygeine, and sanitization solutions.

Our team focuses on extending the digital capabilities of our Supply Chain & Procurement functions, leveraging cloud technology, Power BI, and our own decision support systems to help Ecolab purchase and move materials throughout the globe.

My job is to support and carry out the groundwork of how we move data, derive insights from data, and visualize data (whether aggregated or the result of a DSS) to help our logistics and procurement teams make better decisions. 

### Education

I have quite a passion for lifelong learning. So while much of education is in the *past*, I am definitely continuing to learn new topics right */now*. It's this passion that motivated me to learn web development by making this [website](https://tylerrouze.com/blog/thewhy). More formally, I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a degree in [Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://cse.umn.edu/isye) (yes that's me on the front page!). If you don't know what the IE curriculum entails, it is the science of Decision making, usually based on data, done so via:

* Statistics
* Optimization
* Simulation

Thanks to my time in college, I have strong passions for data-driven solutions and using technology to eliminate repetitive tasks and free up time for more creative tasks.

### Current Interests

Some of my current interests are:

* Aviation ([Microsoft Flight Simulator](https://www.flightsimulator.com/) anyone?)
* Formula 1
* Any book on our Human Nature, especially those with data driven research findings.
* Software Architecture, APIs, and Cloud Tech
* Anything cutting edge involving [Python](https://www.python.org/), [R](https://www.r-project.org/), or [Julia](https://julialang.org/) languages
