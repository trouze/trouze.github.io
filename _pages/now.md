### This page lists the most up-to-date information regarding what I am doing *right now*.

### A little bit about me.
Motorhead, flying, golfing, baseball, hiking, skiing, bread making, guitar, you name it. My passions carry me in many different and odd directions,
but I wouldn't have it any other way. Here's some photos as to what I've been up to of late.

### Life

I currently live in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

### Work

I currently work for [Kambr](https://www.kambr.com/) as an analyst for their Advisory Services Group. Kambr is an airline consultancy that also has a software solution for revenue management, as well as a media group. We are remote by trade, but we have bases in Minneapolis and Amsterdam.

Much of my work for Kambr involves leveraging Data Science, Analysis, and Visualization in order to drive solutions for airline clients across the globe. We are bringing the Data Science revolution to the broader airline industry, and that is my ultimate goal. Reach out if you have any interesting ideas to share!

### Education

I have quite a passion for lifelong learning. So while much of education is in the *past*, I am definitely continuing to learn new topics right */now*. It's this passion that motivated me to learn web development by making this website on my [own](https://tylerrouze.com/blog/thewhy). More formally, I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a degree in [Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://cse.umn.edu/isye). If you don't know what the IE curriculum entails, it is the science of Decision making, done so via:

* Data
* Statistics
* Optimization
* Simulation
* Financial Modeling

Thanks to my time in college, I have strong passions for data-driven solutions and using technology to eliminate repetitive tasks and free up time for more creative tasks.

### Current Interests

It's no secret that our interests change. Some of my current interests are listed below.

* Aviation (Alpha test [Flight Simulator](https://www.flightsimulator.com/) anyone?)
* Any book on Human Nature, especially those with data driven research findings.
* [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) and [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language
* Learning Guitar
* [FI](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/)
