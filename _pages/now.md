### This page lists the most up-to-date information regarding what I am doing *right now*.

### A little bit about me.
Motorhead, flying, golfing, baseball, hiking, skiing, bread making, guitar, you name it. My passions carry me in many different and odd directions,
but I wouldn't have it any other way. Here's some photos as to what I've been up to of late.

### Life

I currently live in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

### Work

I currently work for [Kambr](https://www.kambr.com/) as an analyst. Kambr is an airline consultancy that also has a software solution for revenue management. We are remote by trade, but we have bases in Minneapolis and Amsterdam.

Our mission is to build software and processes that emphasize the human component of technology. We believe that building workflow in which humans and computers work together, as opposed to replacing human interaction altogether, leads to a surprising gain in productivity and effectuality, more so than a computer alone.

My job is to support commercial strategy and analyst workflow building. I also do [some writing](https://www.kambr.media/category/prose-and-contrails) which profiles the commercial side of the aviation industry.

### Education

I have quite a passion for lifelong learning. So while much of education is in the *past*, I am definitely continuing to learn new topics right */now*. It's this passion that motivated me to learn web development by making this website on my [own](https://tylerrouze.com/blog/thewhy). More formally, I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a degree in [Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://cse.umn.edu/isye). If you don't know what the IE curriculum entails, it is the science of Decision making, done so via:

* Data
* Statistics
* Optimization
* Simulation
* Financial Modeling

Thanks to my time in college, I have strong passions for data-driven solutions and using technology to eliminate repetitive tasks and free up time for more creative tasks.

### Current Interests

Some of my current interests are:

* Aviation ([Microsoft Flight Simulator](https://www.flightsimulator.com/) anyone?)
* Any book on our Human Nature, especially those with data driven research findings.
* Software Architecture, APIs, and [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)
* Anything cutting edge involving [Python](https://www.python.org/), [R](https://www.r-project.org/), or [Julia](https://julialang.org/) languages
* Playing Acoustic Guitar

If you share some of the same interests, drop a line below!
