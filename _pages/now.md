### This page lists the most up-to-date information regarding what I am doing *right now*.

### A little bit about me.
Motorhead, flying, golfing, baseball, bread making, guitar, you name it. My passions carry me in many different and odd directions,
but I wouldn't have it any other way. Here's some photos as to what I've been up to of late.

### Life

I currently live in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

### Work

I work for a Private Equity firm, <a href="https://sureswiftcapital.com">SureSwift Capital</a>. My work here consists
of a title Business Analyst Intern, but I really wear a lot of hats because I'm happy to learn just about anything. Most of my time
is spent on reporting for our Software portfolio, as well as vetting inbound businesses for Mergers & Acquisitions.

### School

I currently attend the University of Minnesota studying Industrial and Systems Engineering. Most people don't know or have
a good idea of what ISyE is, so allow me to explain it quickly. There are many ways to put it, but one of the best ways I've come
up with that's resonated with the most people, is that it's the science of decision making. Of course, most majors teach you to make decisions,
but ISyE focuses on doing so via:

* Data
* Statistics
* Optimization
* Simulation
* Financial Modeling

It truly is a catch all major, which is a driving factor as to why IEs work in a multitude of industries.

### Current Interests

It's no secret that our interests change. Not super often, but outside school and work I'm always looking for my next good read. This drives
much of my new interests.

* Aviation (this one doesn't change)
* The Principles of <a href="https://thegogiver.com">The Go Giver</a>
* R Studio
* Investing
* Storytelling
* I/O Psychology
