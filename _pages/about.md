Hi, my name is Tyler!

If you're looking for some background information on the
"Why" of this website, I'll refer you to my first [blog post](https://tylerrouze.com/journal/welcome).

Alternately, if you're looking for some background information on myself, let me first introduce you
to my [Mom's Book](https://www.amazon.com/Life-As-Mommy-Cathy-Spigarelli/dp/1598581244/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=life+as+a+mommy+cathy+spigarelli&qid=1569385541&sr=8-1).

The gift from my mom that keeps on giving, she chronicles a year of my, and my siblings, early lives. You'd be surprised how early personality traits and habits begin to form! Pick up a copy if you want (my mom doesn't make money from it anymore so this *isn't* a shameless plug).

Secondly, take a second look around my VSCO page. I like to use it as a creative outlet.
They say a picture is worth a thousand words, so how about 100 pictures?

Maybe photos didn't do me much justice, so, I'll give you the rundown.

I was born in Louisville, Kentucky, but I'd consider myself a native of Green Bay, Wisconsin
(yes that means Go Pack Go!). I grew up playing a ridiculous amount of baseball in
my childhood, and it dominated much of my life, even into college.

Eventually, I found myself at the University of Minnesota, of which much of this blog
will be launched from. Minnesota has given me a platform to develop my identity
as an analytical problem solver and as a data and statistics nerd.

I've taken on various positions of leadership, and worked my fair share of odd
jobs, both of which I will eventually write about. These experiences, while challenging at the time,
have served to help me find my identity and grow as a person. So please stick around, we've
got plenty to talk about.

Much of my passions outside of school lie in the Aerospace/Airline industry, Travel,
Golf, and Watersports. If you're ever in Minneapolis, send me a message ((920) 883-0984)
and we'll go play 9 holes :).
